<h2>Why does the app check appear when installing (it may not appear)</h2>
<p>It seems to come up in Play Protect. Just click on View more details and then click on Install without checking. </p>
<br>
<h2>why showting This Site is User-Created?</h2>
<p>host by w3School. Just click continue.</p>
<br>
<h2>what not working?</h2>
<p>This was originally going to be the setting, but I deleted it because I thought it would be useless.</p>
<br>
<h2>How to contact us</h2>
<p>The BE version only supports sending emails. After further updates, we plan to make it a Discord server.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why is it different from the app icon? </h2>
<p>I will fix it in BE-0.18Lzs </p>
<br>
<h2>What this app is for</h2>
<p>Originally, I wanted to use it for apps and web, etc., but I thought it wouldn't work, so I use Explorer.</p>
<br>
<h2>Use Explorer</h2>
<p>It is used in Roblox Explorer (actually it is not Explorer, it is a hack). If you don't want to be banned, create a sub-account and use it. </p>
